This application has been implemented in the context of the Data Visualisation subject of the Master's Degree in Data Science at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). The application implemented in R Shiny shows a **contour** representation to explore three dimensions of the data.Contour plots are a way to show a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. It graphs two predictor variables X and Y, and a response variable Z as contours. This type of representation is widely used in cartography. A contour plot is appropiate if you want to see how some value Z changes as a function of two inputs, X and Y: $z=f(x, y)$.

The application uses the shooting position of NBA players in the 2022-2023 season. The X and Y axes represent the shooting position and the contour represents the shot density. The shots are classified into missed and converted shots. The dataset of the 30 NBA teams has been obtained from Kaggle Datasets published by Brendan Keane: [NBA Plays from 2022-2023 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendankdata/nbaplays22-23).
